# dCC_Project1
Ken's first repository doing a project for devCodeCamp's bootcamp.  The project entails the following:

This project is an opportunity to pull all of the fundamental concepts you’ve learned in Python (variables, data types, operators, conditionals, loops, functions, debugging, lists, and source control) and apply them in a single program.

The Day Trip Generator will allow a user to have a random trip generated for them, making it less of a hassle to come up with trip ideas for the day! In it, you’ll utilize just a single Python file for all of the code and practice good debugging techniques, constantly testing every small chunk of code you write as you go along.

Technologies: Python

Resources: Using Functions (Lecture), Lists (Lecture)

Documents: Day Trip Generator User Stories (internal_hidden)
