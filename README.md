This project is an opportunity to pull all of the fundamental concepts that I learned in Python (variables, data types, operators, conditionals, loops, functions, debugging, lists, and source control) to date and apply them in a single program.

This Generator will allow a user to have a random trip generated. It utilizes just a single Python file for all of the code.

Technologies: Python

Resources: Using Functions (Lecture), Lists (Lecture)

Documents: Day Trip Generator User Stories (internal_hidden)
